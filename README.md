## MOA
* A graphic project made by Valentin WOEHREL *

# What was the goal ?
  MOA is a graphic project in C made during my first year at Epitech. The goal was to make a little runner type game while using the CSFML library. The realization of the project took place over 4 weeks and I was able to get grade A thanks to this one.

# Usage
First you need the CSFML library on your PC.
- To compile the project:
```bash
make
```
- To launch the game:
```bash
./my_runner
```
- If you have any question:
```bash
./my_runner -h
```
